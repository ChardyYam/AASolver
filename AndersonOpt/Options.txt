## Number of iterations, must be at least 1.
Iterations  100

## Switch for Anderson Accleration. Set 1 for acceleration, 0 otherwise.
Acceleration  1

## Number of previous iterates used for acceleration. Must be positive.
AndersonM  5

## Solver for the linear system in the global step
## 0 for full solve of the system
## 1 for using one step of Jacobi iteration, similar to [Wang 2015]. The linear system needs to be diagonally dominant.
GlobalUpdateType 0

## Squared spring elasticity, only for physics simulation.
SquareElasticity 5000000

## Simulation time step, only for physics simulation.
